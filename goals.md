# Goals for this project

1. Having the game run on a server that is accessible to everyone.
2. Once a certain net-worth is reached the user gets free access to my game.
3. Users are able to login to the game, and be able to continue from where they left off.
4. Adding back the game that I coded to revert back to state where it all worked.
