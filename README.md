## Setup new players
- The .db file gets created for you by running the program
- All you need to do is download an app called DB Browser (SQLite)
- You then open the program and click "Open Database" --> then Browse Data
## Setup returning players
- The game should recognize that there is a returning user, due to the name being saved in the .db file
